                    <h3>Better Controls and Passthrough Window</h3>
                    <p>
                        Users consistently asked for more intuitive controls so after implementing the core
                        features, we introduced a menu for selecting objects. Users can see which object they
                        have currently selected and see 8 other objects in a convenient grid.

                        Based on Studio 5's playtest feedback, we added the ability to rotate objects using the right
                        hand trigger. This gives more flexibility to the users when placing objects in their room. We
                        also fixed a bug discovered during that same playtesting session where the right index trigger
                        sometimes malfunctions. We had trouble fixing this bug at first because it cannot be reproduced
                        consistently. After extensive research, we found a <a
                            href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/ovrinput-button-secondaryhandtrigger-not-working-correctly.749048/#post-5333142">Unity
                            forum post</a> that had the exact same
                        problem as us. It turns out that when the controllers don't move for a period of
                        time or no buttons are pressed they are deactivated. SecondaryIndexTrigger then can become
                        PrimaryIndexTrigger from one frame to another and vice versa. We had to set the button to
                        RawButton.RIndexTrigger to fix this bug.

                        We also implemented the passthrough window planned last week. Coupled with improvements to
                        the passthrough shader, the window feature lit up the room and made the environment more
                        realistic
                        and immersive.

                    <h3>Rebranding and Change of Business Plan</h3>
                    <p>
                        Based on instructor's feedback about the scope of this project, we decided to rebrand as RenovAR
                        instead of
                        RemodAR. We think that renovation is a better term to describe the purpose of our project while
                        remodelling
                        , like breaking down walls etc, is very hard to achieve in current AR. While it's possible to
                        break down walls
                        and allow the user to peak into the room behind the wall, the user still cannot physically walk
                        through the gap
                        because we only destructed the wall virtually.

                        We reconsidered our current subscription-based business plan
                        and decided to switch to posit ourselves as the next digital marketplace for renovation.
                        Since we are not making furniture and paint, it is natural to host products from existing
                        companies that make these products. Brands like IKEA and Amazon will have the incentive to
                        display
                        their products on our marketplace because it's a low-stake way to experiment with cutting-edge
                        passthrough AR
                        tech that complements the existing mobile AR solutions they have in-house. Customers would want
                        to shop on
                        our platforms because we offer much wider range of selections than other AR renovation apps like
                        Housecraft, which
                        has less than 40 low-fidelity toy furniture models.

                    <h3>Plan for Next Week</h3>
                    <p> In the upcoming week, we plan to
                    <ol>
                        <li>Continue to refine the controls by introducing a way to delete objects</li>
                        <li>Show progressive hints on how to use the controller as the user try out new features</li>
                        <li>Add more objects to place on
                            the walls and ceilings.</li>
                    </ol>
