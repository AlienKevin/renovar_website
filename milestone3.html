                    <h3>Intuitive Controls and Enhanced Passthrough</h3>

                    <p>In response to user feedback requesting more intuitive controls, we introduced an object
                        selection menu after implementing the core features. This menu allows users to easily see their
                        currently selected object and choose from 8 other objects in a convenient grid layout.</p>

                    <p>We now support rotating objects using the right hand trigger, based on feedback from
                        last week's playtest session with Studio 5. This provides users with greater flexibility when
                        placing objects
                        in their space. During that same playtesting, we uncovered a bug where the right index
                        trigger would sometimes malfunction. The inconsistent reproduction of this issue made it
                        challenging to resolve initially. Digging deeper, a <a
                            href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/ovrinput-button-secondaryhandtrigger-not-working-correctly.749048/#post-5333142">Unity
                            forum post</a> shed light on the root cause: controller deactivation due to inactivity
                        causes
                        the PrimaryIndexTrigger to switch to the left hand.
                        Setting the button to RawButton.RIndexTrigger fixed the bug.</p>

                    <p>Another key addition was the passthrough window, as planned last week. Paired with enhancements
                        to the passthrough shader, this feature significantly brightened up the room, resulting in a
                        more realistic and immersive environment.</p>

                    <h3>RenovAR: Rebranding and Pivoting Business Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Taking the instructor's feedback about project scope into consideration, we decided to rebrand as
                        RenovAR instead of RemodAR. The term "renovation" better aligns with our project's purpose, as
                        "remodeling" often involves more extensive changes like breaking down walls, which are currently
                        challenging to achieve realistically in AR.</p>

                    <p>We also reevaluated our subscription-based business model and pivoted to position ourselves as
                        the leading digital marketplace for renovation. Partnering with established brands like IKEA and
                        Amazon to host their products on our platform is a natural fit, as we aren't manufacturing
                        furniture or paint ourselves. Joining forces with industry leaders like IKEA and Amazon to
                        showcase their products on our platform benefits all parties involved. For these companies,
                        RenovAR presents a unique opportunity to explore the potential of cutting-edge passthrough AR
                        tech without significant investment, serving as a valuable complement to their existing
                        in-house mobile AR solutions. This partnership also opens up the possibility of integrating our
                        product into one of these established brands, increasing our long-term viability in the market.
                        Most importantly, customers will be drawn to our platform's vast selection, far surpassing other
                        AR renovation apps like Housecraft, which offers fewer than 40 low-fidelity furniture
                        models.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>In the coming week, we plan to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Further refine controls by introducing object deletion functionality</li>
                        <li>Implement progressive hints to guide users as they explore new features</li>
                        <li>Expand the object library to include more items for walls and ceilings</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
