        <h3>Milestone 2 (April 1 - 8, 2024)</h3>

        <p>
            The Meta Scene API is missing crucial features like loading room models.
            https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Unity-VR-Development/How-to-save-and-load-room-layouts-with-the-quest3/td-p/1095799

            After inspecting the documentation closely, it seems that it's impossible load a room model programmatically
            because "OVRSceneAnchors are created by the OVRSceneManager and cannot be created by the user".

        <h3>Milestone 1 (March 25 - 31, 2024)</h3>

        <h4>Choice of Technology</h4>
        <p>
            After careful consideration, we chose to develop RemodAR using AR on the Meta Quest 3 headset.
            AR allows users to experience their unique remodeled space by physically walking through it, providing
            a more immersive and realistic experience compared to VR, which often relies on fixed viewpoints or awkward
            teleportation movement. The Meta Quest 3 headset's high-fidelity passthrough and wide field-of-view deliver
            the level of immersion necessary for visualizing a remodeling project, surpassing the limitations of small
            mobile device screens.
        </p>
        <h4>Testing the Water</h4>
        <p>
            As newcomers to the AR features of the Meta Quest platform, we began by downloading and building a demo game
            called <a href="https://github.com/oculus-samples/Unity-Phanto">Phanto</a>, provided by Meta, on the Quest
            Pro.
            This game showcased several crucial AR features needed for our project, including passthrough, scene
            recognition, and object placement. Although we successfully compiled and ran the game on the Quest Pro, we
            discovered that it does not support the scene mesh API required for room scanning, scene recognition, and
            object
            placement. Moreover, the passthrough quality was unstable, grainy, and lacked color. These limitations made
            it
            clear that the Quest Pro could not deliver the immersive AR experience required forRemodAR.
            As a result, we decided to purchase a Quest 3 to further explore its potential for our project.

            The Quest 3 exceeded our expectations. The Phanto game worked seamlessly on the Quest 3, and we were
            impressed
            by the high precision of its room scanning capability. The device allowed us to place virtual weapons on any
            physical surface with remarkable accuracy, and the enemies spawned at realistic, unoccupied locations within
            the
            room, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

        <h4>First Proof-of-Concept</h4>
        <p>
            Encouraged by the Quest 3's capabilities demonstrated in the Phanto game, we proceeded to follow the first
            part
            of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_1Xby35fSo">Meta Quest Scene API YouTube tutorial</a> to
            implement the most basic features of home remodeling: changing floor tiles and painting walls. This initial
            proof-of-concept allowed us to lay the foundation for our RemodAR application. The demo video below was
            filmed
            in an occupied room with furniture but we intend the experience to be taken place in a new, empty,
            unfurnished
            room where the customer can walk around more freely. In the coming week, we plan to expand on this by
            enabling
            users to select from a variety of floor tiles and wallpapers, as well as experiment with adding furniture to
            the
            virtual room.
