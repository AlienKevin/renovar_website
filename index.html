        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            RemodAR lets homeowners experience their final remodeled home before the first hammer swings using Augmented
            Reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our AR technology projects your renovation plans into your actual space, allowing you to walk through,
            interact
            with, and refine every detail until it's perfect.
        </p>

        <h2>Business Model</h2>
        <h3>Market opportunity</h3>
        <p>
            The U.S. residential remodeling market size was estimated at USD 527.36 billion in 2023 and
            is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6% from 2024 to 2030. We will be
            targeting the mid-to-high end customers who value the benefits of visualizing their remodeling projects in
            detail before committing to the work. These customers are more likely to invest in technology that can save
            them time, money, and stress in the long run as their remodeling projects are often highly personalized,
            intricate, and costly.
        </p>
        <h3>Income</h3>
        <p>
            We will not charge homeowner anything but will sell our service to designers who need a better way
            of showcasing their design and gaining customer satisfaction. We will have two- tiered pricing model
            where
            independent designers will be charged $50 a month and a team of less than 5 designers will be charged
            $200 a
            month for additional collaborative features.
        </p>
        <h3>Expenses</h3>
        <p>The main expanse is the cost for developing the software. There are two parts to the software: one
            is designer facing and need to integrate with existing design frameworks and the other one is homeowner
            facing and need high-fidelity rendering for an appealing presentation. Our team also needs to get access
            to the latest headsets like Quest 3 and Vision Pro, which costs from $1,499 to $3,499. The team also
            needs pay for a license for the Unity game engine, which costs $2,040 per year per seat. Lastly, there
            is cost for setting up the company website, marketing, and general operation costs like rent.

        <h2>Development Blog</h2>

        <h3>Milestone 2 (April 1 - 8, 2024)</h3>

        <p>
            Based on playtest results, we found that users want to be able to
            interact with virtual objects and have them naturally
            coexist with the real objects and environment.
            So this week, we focused on three features to address these needs:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Changing textures on walls, floors, and ceilings</li>
            <li>Adding objects into the room</li>
            <li>Fusing real-world objects with the virtual environment</li>
        </ol>

                allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

        <h3>Challenges with Passthrough</h3>
        <p> The first two features, raycasting and object placement, are relatively straightforward because we can treat
            the scanned room as a virtual environment. These features work similarly to how they function in VR, with
            controller input being used to interact with the environment. However, we encountered difficulties with the
            third feature: displaying real objects in the scene. After extensive research, we discovered that the
            Passthrough API provided by Meta currently only offers coarse-grained control, such as underlaying or
            overlaying the virtual scene. While real objects like furniture can be scanned using the API, we found that
            enabling floor or wall texture overlays would directly cover the passthrough video feed. This means that the
            overlays are not seamlessly integrated into the 3D environment as we initially thought. </p>
        <p> Fortunately, Quinten Dauwe, a fellow Mixed Reality developer from the <a
                href="https://discord.gg/v8fVjweUPB">Black
                Whale Studio's XR Dev Discord</a>, kindly pointed us towards Selective Passthrough. We had previously
            watched many of the studio's high-quality MR tutorials for the Meta Presence API and joined their Discord
            channel after attempting to tweak the default passthrough shader without success. With Quinten's guidance,
            we were able
            to selectively display scanned furniture in passthrough, although the textures are still overlaid on top of
            the passthrough feed. </p>
        <h3>Plan for Next Week</h3>
        <p> In the upcoming week, we plan to:
        <ol>
            <li>Explore Meta's <a
                    href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-mr-utility-kit-overview/">Mixed Reality
                    Utility Kit</a> (MRUK), which Quinten mentioned.</li>
            <p>We discovered that this kit not only creates convenient
                abstractions over the Scene API but also provides ways to test our MR apps in the Unity editor with 30
                pre-made room prefabs. Over the next week, we will be porting existing logic from the Scene API to the
                MRUK.
                We hope that MRUK will offer a better way to mix passthrough with overlay textures.
            </p>
            <li>Develop a new passthrough window feature</li>
            <p>
                This feature will allow users to seamlessly view their backyard or outdoor
                surroundings from within the virtual space. It aims to bridge the gap between the real and virtual
                worlds by providing users with a simultaneous view of both environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The introduction of a passthrough window is expected to significantly enhance the user experience and
                provide a more comprehensive perspective during the interior design process. By incorporating the real
                outdoor scenery, users can better assess how their interior design choices interact with and complement
                the
                exterior view. This holistic approach enables homeowners and designers to make more informed decisions,
                ensuring that the interior design harmonizes with the surrounding environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, most 3D renderings created by interior designers rely on artificial or generic outdoor
                scenery
                when depicting windows. However, the RemodAR team recognizes that the outside view is often just as
                crucial
                as the interior design and should be given more consideration during the planning phase. By leveraging
                the
                passthrough window feature, RemodAR aims to provide a more realistic and personalized design experience,
                setting itself apart from traditional rendering methods.
            </p>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Milestone 1 (March 25 - 31, 2024)</h3>

        <h4>Choice of Technology</h4>
        <p>
            After careful consideration, we chose to develop RemodAR using AR on the Meta Quest 3 headset.
            AR allows users to experience their unique remodeled space by physically walking through it, providing
            a more immersive and realistic experience compared to VR, which often relies on fixed viewpoints or
            awkward
            teleportation movement. The Meta Quest 3 headset's high-fidelity passthrough and wide field-of-view
            deliver
            the level of immersion necessary for visualizing a remodeling project, surpassing the limitations of
            small
            mobile device screens.
        </p>
        <h4>Testing the Water</h4>
        <p>
            As newcomers to the AR features of the Meta Quest platform, we began by downloading and building a demo
            game
            called <a href="https://github.com/oculus-samples/Unity-Phanto">Phanto</a>, provided by Meta, on the
            Quest
            Pro.
            This game showcased several crucial AR features needed for our project, including passthrough, scene
            recognition, and object placement. Although we successfully compiled and ran the game on the Quest Pro,
            we
            discovered that it does not support the scene mesh API required for room scanning, scene recognition,
            and
            object
            placement. Moreover, the passthrough quality was unstable, grainy, and lacked color. These limitations
            made
            it
            clear that the Quest Pro could not deliver the immersive AR experience required forRemodAR.
            As a result, we decided to purchase a Quest 3 to further explore its potential for our project.

            The Quest 3 exceeded our expectations. The Phanto game worked seamlessly on the Quest 3, and we were
            impressed
            by the high precision of its room scanning capability. The device allowed us to place virtual weapons on
            any
            physical surface with remarkable accuracy, and the enemies spawned at realistic, unoccupied locations
            within
            the
            room, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

        <h4>First Proof-of-Concept</h4>
        <p>
            Encouraged by the Quest 3's capabilities demonstrated in the Phanto game, we proceeded to follow the
            first
            part
            of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_1Xby35fSo">Meta Quest Scene API YouTube tutorial</a> to
            implement the most basic features of home remodeling: changing floor tiles and painting walls. This
            initial
            proof-of-concept allowed us to lay the foundation for our RemodAR application. The demo video below was
            filmed
            in an occupied room with furniture but we intend the experience to be taken place in a new, empty,
            unfurnished
            room where the customer can walk around more freely. In the coming week, we plan to expand on this by
            enabling
            users to select from a variety of floor tiles and wallpapers, as well as experiment with adding
            furniture to
            the
            virtual room.
