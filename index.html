        <h3>Milestone 2 (April 1 - 8, 2024)</h3>

        <p>
            Based on playtest results, we found that users want to be able to
            interact with virtual objects and have them naturally
            coexist with the real objects and environment.
            So this week, we focused on three features to address these needs:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Changing textures on walls, floors, and ceilings</li>
            <li>Adding objects into the room</li>
            <li>Fusing real-world objects with the virtual environment</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The first two are relatively straightforward because we can treat just the scanned room as a virtual
            environment. Raycasting, object placement, and controller input work the same way as in VR. However, we had
            trouble with the third feature: showing real objects in the scene. After in-depth research, we found that
            the Passthrough API provided by Meta currently only support
            very coarse
            grained control like underlay vs overlay over the virtual scene. Real objects like furniture can be scanned
            using the
            API. However, it turned out that turning on floor or wall texture overlay would directly cover the
            passthrough video feed, meaning that the overlays are not actually fit into the 3D environment like we
            thought before.
        </p>
        <p>
            After watching all the Scene API YouTube tutorials we can find and searching on the Meta Community Forums,
            we
            concluded that more API support is needed to support proper integration of passthrough and virtual objects.
            In fact, Meta
            is in the process of developing a <a
                href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-depthapi/">Depth API</a>
            which exposes real-time sensed environment depth to apps in the form of depth maps to complement the current
            Scene API. However, we have yet to figure out how the Depth API can be combined with Passthrough to show
            real objects
            alongside virtual ones and we think the complexity might be outside the scope of this project.
        <p>
            Hence for the next week, we want to focus on a more actionable AR feature: adding a window to the room so
            that users can
            peek through the virtual scene into their own backyard! This will be our first feature to expose the user to
            both the real
            and the virtual world at the same time.
        </p>

        <h3>Milestone 1 (March 25 - 31, 2024)</h3>

        <h4>Choice of Technology</h4>
        <p>
            After careful consideration, we chose to develop RemodAR using AR on the Meta Quest 3 headset.
            AR allows users to experience their unique remodeled space by physically walking through it, providing
            a more immersive and realistic experience compared to VR, which often relies on fixed viewpoints or awkward
            teleportation movement. The Meta Quest 3 headset's high-fidelity passthrough and wide field-of-view deliver
            the level of immersion necessary for visualizing a remodeling project, surpassing the limitations of small
            mobile device screens.
        </p>
        <h4>Testing the Water</h4>
        <p>
            As newcomers to the AR features of the Meta Quest platform, we began by downloading and building a demo game
            called <a href="https://github.com/oculus-samples/Unity-Phanto">Phanto</a>, provided by Meta, on the Quest
            Pro.
            This game showcased several crucial AR features needed for our project, including passthrough, scene
            recognition, and object placement. Although we successfully compiled and ran the game on the Quest Pro, we
            discovered that it does not support the scene mesh API required for room scanning, scene recognition, and
            object
            placement. Moreover, the passthrough quality was unstable, grainy, and lacked color. These limitations made
            it
            clear that the Quest Pro could not deliver the immersive AR experience required forRemodAR.
            As a result, we decided to purchase a Quest 3 to further explore its potential for our project.

            The Quest 3 exceeded our expectations. The Phanto game worked seamlessly on the Quest 3, and we were
            impressed
            by the high precision of its room scanning capability. The device allowed us to place virtual weapons on any
            physical surface with remarkable accuracy, and the enemies spawned at realistic, unoccupied locations within
            the
            room, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

        <h4>First Proof-of-Concept</h4>
        <p>
            Encouraged by the Quest 3's capabilities demonstrated in the Phanto game, we proceeded to follow the first
            part
            of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_1Xby35fSo">Meta Quest Scene API YouTube tutorial</a> to
            implement the most basic features of home remodeling: changing floor tiles and painting walls. This initial
            proof-of-concept allowed us to lay the foundation for our RemodAR application. The demo video below was
            filmed
            in an occupied room with furniture but we intend the experience to be taken place in a new, empty,
            unfurnished
            room where the customer can walk around more freely. In the coming week, we plan to expand on this by
            enabling
            users to select from a variety of floor tiles and wallpapers, as well as experiment with adding furniture to
            the
            virtual room.
