                    <p>
                        Based on playtest results, we found that users want to be able to
                        interact with virtual objects and have them naturally
                        coexist with the real objects and environment.
                        So this week, we focused on three features to address these needs:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Changing textures on walls, floors, and ceilings</li>
                        <li>Adding objects into the room</li>
                        <li>Fusing real-world objects with the virtual environment</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Challenges with Passthrough</h3>
                    <p> The first two features, raycasting and object placement, are relatively straightforward because
                        we can treat
                        the scanned room as a virtual environment. These features work similarly to how they function in
                        VR, with
                        controller input being used to interact with the environment. However, we encountered
                        difficulties with the
                        third feature: displaying real objects in the scene. After extensive research, we discovered
                        that the
                        Passthrough API provided by Meta currently only offers coarse-grained control, such as
                        underlaying or
                        overlaying the virtual scene. While real objects like furniture can be scanned using the API, we
                        found that
                        enabling floor or wall texture overlays would directly cover the passthrough video feed. This
                        means that the
                        overlays are not seamlessly integrated into the 3D environment as we initially thought. </p>

                    <p> Fortunately, Quinten Dauwe, a fellow Mixed Reality developer from the <a
                            href="https://discord.gg/v8fVjweUPB">Black
                            Whale Studio's XR Dev Discord</a>, kindly pointed us towards Selective Passthrough. We had
                        previously
                        watched many of the studio's high-quality MR tutorials for the Meta Presence API and joined
                        their Discord
                        channel after attempting to tweak the default passthrough shader without success. With Quinten's
                        guidance,
                        we were able
                        to selectively display scanned furniture in passthrough, although the textures are still
                        overlaid on top of
                        the passthrough feed. </p>
                    <hr />

                    <h3>Plan for Next Week</h3>
                    <p> In the upcoming week, we plan to:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Explore Meta's <a
                                href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/unity-mr-utility-kit-overview/">Mixed
                                Reality
                                Utility Kit</a> (MRUK), which Quinten mentioned.</li>
                        <p>We discovered that this kit not only creates convenient
                            abstractions over the Scene API but also provides ways to test our MR apps in the Unity
                            editor with 30
                            pre-made room prefabs. Over the next week, we will be porting existing logic from the Scene
                            API to the
                            MRUK.
                            We hope that MRUK will offer a better way to mix passthrough with overlay textures.
                        </p>
                        <li>Develop a new passthrough window feature</li>
                        <p>
                            This feature will allow users to seamlessly view their backyard or outdoor
                            surroundings from within the virtual space. It aims to bridge the gap between the real and
                            virtual
                            worlds by providing users with a simultaneous view of both environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The introduction of a passthrough window is expected to significantly enhance the user
                            experience and
                            provide a more comprehensive perspective during the interior design process. By
                            incorporating the real
                            outdoor scenery, users can better assess how their interior design choices interact with and
                            complement
                            the
                            exterior view. This holistic approach enables homeowners and designers to make more informed
                            decisions,
                            ensuring that the interior design harmonizes with the surrounding environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, most 3D renderings created by interior designers rely on artificial or generic
                            outdoor
                            scenery
                            when depicting windows. However, the RemodAR team recognizes that the outside view is often
                            just as
                            crucial
                            as the interior design and should be given more consideration during the planning phase. By
                            leveraging
                            the
                            passthrough window feature, RemodAR aims to provide a more realistic and personalized design
                            experience,
                            setting itself apart from traditional rendering methods.
